## REQUIREMENTS:
* Pandas
* Numpy
* Seaborn
* Matplotlib
* SKlearn
## WHY SPLITTING DATA:
If we divide the data after feature engineering part the std[standard deviation and variance] will be completely different for both train and test this leads to data leakage, so to overcome this I am splitting the data and applying the operations on train same result saving it for test.
## Accuracies got after model training:

Since data is already clean so i used multiple regression for model training.

After training the results i got:

Accuracy:0.9999999802520281
